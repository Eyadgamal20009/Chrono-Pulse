# ⏱️ Chrono Pulse - Photogate Project
> **A Sustainable Solution for Precision Physics Measurements**

**Chrono Pulse** is a high-precision photogate sensor system constructed entirely from recycled electronic components. Developed by **Group 21205** (Grade 11 STEM Students), this project addresses Egypt's electronic waste challenge while providing a low-cost, professional-grade tool for physics laboratories.

## 📊 Project Highlights
- **Accuracy:** 98.7% (Measured $g$ = 9.679 m/s²)
- **Cost:** ~175 EGP (vs. thousands for commercial alternatives)
- **Sustainability:** 100% Recycled electronic components
- **Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Canvas API)

## 🛠️ How It Works
The system uses a laser diode and receiver harvested from waste electronics, controlled by a recycled ATmega328P microcontroller. 
1. **Laser Source:** Emits a continuous beam.
2. **Receiver:** Detects beam interruptions.
3. **Microcontroller:** Calculates time/velocity with microsecond precision.
4. **Web Interface:** This repository hosts the presentation interface, showcasing the methodology, results, and team info.
